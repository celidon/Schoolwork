An egg
A pan

Put a pan on the stove.
Light the burner under the pan and set it to medium heat.
Take an egg out of the fridge.
Crack the egg and put just the inner part into the hot pan.
Throw away the shell.
When the egg white is actually cooked white, flip the egg.
In 30-45 seconds, turn off the stove, take the egg out of the pan and put it on the plate

It worked perfectly.
