a)  First fit: Find any parking space in the parking lot.
    Park there and walk to the store.
b)  Best fit: Drive to the front of the parking lot. Search
    for a space in the quarter closest to the store. Park when
	such a space is found.
c)  First fit saves more time because you are already walking
    while the person following best fit is still looking for a
	place to park their car.
