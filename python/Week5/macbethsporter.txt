Here's a knocking indeed!
If a man were porter of hell-gate, he should have old turning the key.

Knock, knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of Beelzebub? 
Here's a farmer, that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty:
come in time; have napkins enow about you; here you'll sweat for't.

Knock, knock! Who's there, in the other devil's name?
Faith, here's an equivocator,
that could swear in both the scales against either scale;
who committed treason enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven:
O, come in, equivocator.

Knock, knock, knock! Who's there?
Faith, here's an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French hose:
come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose.

Knock, knock; never at quiet! What are you?
But this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter it no further:
I had thought to have let in some of all professions 
that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire.

Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.
